        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <br>
        <b>Robocode runner up</b>
        <br>
        <b><i>March 2020</i></b>
        <br>
        <p>In this competition, each team had to implement a fighting robot using Java language to compete against
            other robots from various Universities and Colleges from across the island of Ireland. The graphical
            tanks need to be programmed to avoid being hit and be smart enough to move around an arena
            without any kind of manual control. All of their intelligence is part of a single Java file. Each RoboCode
            match normally lasts less than three minutes, until one robot tank is destroyed.</p>
        <p>I was a member of Team TALOS which had 3 members in total, we placed second in the competition in March 2020. <a href="https://gamesfleadh.ie/robocode/">Here</a> is a link to the event page that goes into more detail about this competition.</p>
